# Deep QLearning Demo dotNet
This demo is a C# port of [ConvNetJS Reinforcement Learning Demo](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/rldemo.html) by Andrej Karpathy.
Watch the demo video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTgI_-yYlBA&t=9s).
This project also uses Cedric Bovar's [ConvNetSharp library](https://github.com/cbovar/ConvNetSharp) for the Convolutional Neural Networks.

# Pretrained model
I included a pretrained model that I trained for a few hours, you can load and use it if you don't like waiting :)
